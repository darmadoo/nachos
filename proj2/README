Mark Darmadi
	- what code you wrote
		Initial stages of handleWrite, handleRead, handleHalt changes and getFile
		and addToFiles. 
		Worked on the first part of loadSection.
		getReadTE and getWriteTE are just helper methods for tableEntries. 
		rewrote with Kacy how readWriteHelper was implemented. 
	- how well it worked
		For all the functions written, no corner case checks were made. Mo was 
		responsible for all the error checkings.
		Added extra checks to make sure that the loadSection was fully implemented
	- how Mark contributed to the project
		Significant part in handleWrite, handleRead, handleOpen, getFile, addToFiles, handleExit, allocatePages and releasePages. 
		
Mohammed Islam
	- what code you wrote
		Most of the system call handler functions, handleCreat, handleOpen, handleRead, handleWrite, handleClose, handleUnlink, handleExec, handleUnlink
		Worked on readWriteHelper with Micah to complete writeVirtualMemory and
		readVirtualMemory
		Completed unloadSection
	- how well it worked
		We were getting caught in infinite loops all the time which was why write10 was failing alot and the we were failing the two last chekcs in the autograder. 
	- how Mo contributed to the project
		Mostly working all over the place with everything. Guiding Mark and Micah what else is left to be implemented and touching almost every part of the code we wrote. 
		

Micah Rothenbuhler	
	- what code you wrote
		helped write the skeleton for handleExec, handleUnlink and handleExit
		ReadVirtualMemory and WriteVirtualMemory.
	- how well it worked
		With the help of Kacy and other tutors. The implementation for ReadVirtualMemory and WriteVirtualMemory was easily laid out and not much corner case testing was needed because of the tutor's aid. 
	- how Micah contributed to the project
		Made sure all our codes were commented thoroughly and wrote a significant chunk of ReadVirtualMemory and WriteVirtualMemory.


how was the code tested
	Code was tested using the test initially provided. Also used tests the volker made, write1, write4, write10, and snake.
	We also made a new test function called halt.c which tested the functionality of halt. 
	Attempts were made in testing the pageTable and the entryTranslation by reversing the order of the mapping but we gave up because we did not know if our implementation was actually right and we were not exactly sure if we are tesing the right thing. 
	Milestone checks were also made. Such as after implementing exec, we created a process and ran it just for sanity checks. 
	Same thing was done for handleRead, handleWrite, handleOpen where we would hard code the file name to just see if it was working.
